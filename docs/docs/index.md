# Mify Intro

## Why Mify

Starting a new project is a repetitive and unnecessarily complicated task.
Every time you need to choose a language, find a framework, set up storage,
configuration, logging, metrics, and many more things, duct tape it all
together until it works. And after all that you need to write infrastructure
code and configs to set up deployment.

But it doesn't have to be that way - Mify is designed to remove this repetitive
work from a developer and generate everything required to just start writing
meaningful code. With Mify these steps, which would take you months, are
implemented in simple commands of a CLI tool.

### Why not use NoCode or Lambda

It's true that you can use no code or low-code solutions to skip these hurdles
but these platforms only solve limited use cases, and it's hard to move out of
them if you need something more, so after a while, you would have to throw away
all of your work to continue expanding the project.

We believe in open platforms and Mify, which is an open-source tool, doesn't
lock you in, in our generated code we strive to use the best industry practices
which will help your project in a long term.
