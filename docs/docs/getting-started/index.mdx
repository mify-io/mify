# Get started

Mify is an open-source developer productivity tool which generates
infrastructure code for your backend service and maintains it as your codebase grow.

It provides infra code for stuff like API, configs, logs, and metrics, allowing
you and your team to focus on meaningful code. Services generated by Mify can
be deployed in our cloud without any tedious configuration or hosted in the
cloud of your choice where Mify (Pro) can generate Terraform configs for you
infra and deployment.

## Installing Mify

Before using the CLI you need to install and start Docker which is used for running
some code generation tasks, You can refer to Docker's
[guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for installation.
Right now Mify should work on Linux, Mac and WSL.

Here are the steps for installation:

<InstallGuide/>

Or you can get the latest Mify CLI directly from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/mify-io/mify/releases) page.

## Creating your first project

After installing Mify CLI call this command:
```
mify init <project-name>
```

You will see a directory called `<project-name>` which is now your workspace where you can add your services.
Go into workpace with `cd <project-name>` and create your first service:
```
mify add service <service-name>
```
You will see that this command generated a service in `go-services` directory.
In `schemas/<service-name>/api.yaml` there is OpenAPI schema which is a starting point
for creating service handlers. Run `mify generate` after changing the schema and
new handler will appear at `go-services/internal/<service-name>/handlers/path/to/api/service.go`.

And if you also run:
```
mify add frontend <frontend-service-name>
```
As the name of this command suggests, this will be your project's frontend.
After running this command you will find it in a `js-services` directory.

### Running the service

Get into go-services directory and install dependencies:

```
$ cd go-services
$ go mod tidy
```

Build and run the service:

```
$ go run ./cmd/<service-name>
```

Follow this [guide](/docs/cloud/overview)  to deploy it to Mify Cloud with single command `mify cloud deploy`.
