# OpenAPI

Mify uses OpenAPI [specification](https://swagger.io/specification/) to
simplify creating API between services and frontends. Check it out to find out
how to use it or use [this
example](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/examples/v3.0/petstore-expanded.yaml),
and here we'll describe additional features that our generation provides on
top.

## Middlewares and ServiceExtra

In `internal/<service-name>/app/router/router.go` you can see this layout:

```go
// vim: set ft=go:

package app

import (
	"net/http"

	"example.com/namespace/wtest1/go-services/internal/svc1/generated/core"
)

type routerConfig struct {
	Middlewares []func(http.Handler) http.Handler
}

func NewRouterConfig(ctx *core.MifyServiceContext) *routerConfig {
	return &routerConfig {
		Middlewares: []func(http.Handler) http.Handler {
		// Add your middlewares here
		},
	}
}
```

In `NewRouterConfig` you can add your custom middlewares e.g. for auth.

To add some dependencies which are bootstrapping for each request you can use file `internal/<service-name>/app/request_extra.go` and this dependency will be available in the `MifyRequestContext` struct.
For dependencies which are bootstrapping for service one time during initialization you can use `internal/<service-name>/app/service_extra.go` and this dependency will be available in the `MifyServiceContext` struct (which is nested in `MifyRequestContext`)

## Swagger UI

Swagger UI is available for every backend service on maintenance port (you can
get it from the service startup logs). To be able to call API from it, add your
local and prod service url to `schemas/<service-name>/api/api.yaml` to
`servers` field.
