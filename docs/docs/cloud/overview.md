# Mify Cloud Overview

Mify Cloud allows you to deploy Mify generated services without any tedious
configuration with just a simple `mify deploy` command call.

In the next sections we will describe how to prepare your workspace and
services for deployment. Right now Mify Cloud is in beta, so ping us on Slack
to try it out.
