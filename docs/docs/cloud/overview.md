# Mify Cloud Overview

Mify Cloud allows you to deploy Mify generated services without any tedious
configuration with just a simple `mify deploy` command call.

In the next sections we will describe how to prepare your workspace and
services for deployment. Right now Mify Cloud is in beta, so ping us on
[Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/mifyio/shared_invite/zt-1llnbiio6-lG45E696QOEVzHb0__Qqxw)
to try it out.
